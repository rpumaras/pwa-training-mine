## Purpose

Add to Homescreen is a feature of the Android Chrome browser which allows the 'installation' of the PWA to a user's homescreen behind a app icon. The user can then launch the site, in the same way they might launch an app, as a focussed experience without the browser bar.

## Appropriate Uses

- An alternative header bar component that reintroduces actions lost from removing the browser UI, such as Share, Back and Refresh.
- An overflow menu that allows all the necessary global actions to be kept in the header bar where there isn't a lot of space.

## User Interactions

- All actions in the header bar should perform the same reaction as the PWA header bar.
- The overflow button opens a menu of items, including links and triggers.
- Forward returns the user to the previous screen (after going back).
- Share triggers the [Web Share API](#!/Share).
- If a user pulls down while browsing PWAs from the homescreen, the refresh action in initiated the same way it is in the browser.
- If a user progresses past the initial page, the menu action is replaced by the back button.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- In order to provide an experience cohesive with a native Android app, the alignment of the logo in the header bar should move to the left next to the menu icon.
- App icons should be exported in several sizes and named appropriately. Export guidelines can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen)
- It is recommended to use [Google's Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons/) for the actions that replace the browser UI (e.g Back) to make the homescreen launched PWA appear as a native Android app.
- Remove labels from icons in the header bar that mimic browser behavior as add to homescreen users can be assumed to have clarity on these actions.
- The top actions in the overflow menu should mimic those found in the PWA header bar.

## Accessibility

- After the overflow menu is opened, disable all other actions on the page (including scrolling), tapping outside the menu closes the menu.
- The header bar should be stuck to the top of the browser in order to aid navigation back and forwards through pages.
