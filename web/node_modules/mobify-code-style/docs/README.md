> Write great documentation! ‚Äì¬†\* [_Mobify Developer Values_](https://github.com/mobify/developer-values#Ô∏è-write-great-documentation)

At Mobify, documentation is written in markdown.

Documentation should live as close as possible to the code it documents.
Typically, this means including it in a `docs` folder at the root of the repo.
Customer facing documentation should be published to a sub path of
docs.mobify.com.

To make writing document easier, we provide:

- A linter for consistent markdown style.
- A writing checklist for consistent process.

### Markdown Linting

```bash
npm install --save-dev mobify-code-style

# üèÉ the linter markdown files in the `docs` folder:
./node_modules/.bin/lint-md docs

# Arguments are passed to `remark-cli`: https://github.com/wooorm/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-cli
./node_modules/.bin/lint-md --watch docs

# Try to automajically fix linting warnings:
./node_modules/.bin/lint-md --output docs
```

### Writing Checklist

**Before you start writing**

Write down the goal of your document.

- Does a similar document exist? Could it be extended to meet the goal?
- Does your document fit in an existing category? If so, which one?

Who is your audience? What is their skill level?

What kind of document best meets your goal?
